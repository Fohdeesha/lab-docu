# Linux Live ISO Build

These are the files required to build the Debian 11 live ISO with the custom flashing files.  

It requires a basic `lb build` setup/environment. If you're just looking for the custom scripts/firmware files, they're under [/config/includes.chroot_after_packages](https://github.com/Fohdeesha/lab-docu/tree/master/Perc%20Guide%20Source%20Files/Linux%20ISO%20Build/config/includes.chroot_after_packages)
