;                     has 784 cylinders, 255 heads, and 63 sectors.  If 
;                     EMULATE_DISK is not set to off fdisk will automatically
;                     enter its read only mode.
;         *  OFF
;            1 TO 8
;
; FLAG_SECTOR       Sector number where the flags will be located.  The 
;                     default is 2.   
;            0      Disables sector flagging function.
;            2 - 64 Flag sector.
;            256    Set the flag sector to the last sector in the first
;                     cylinder of the first hard disk.
;
; LABEL      ON     Displays "Free FDISK" along the right hand side of the
;                     screen to help avoid confusion between this program
;                     and "other" FDISK programs.
;         *  OFF    No "Free FDISK" label is displayed along the right
;                     hand side of the screen.
;
; MONO       ON     The menus will be displayed without boldfacing the text

;         *  OFF    The menus have boldfaced text.
;
;
; REBOOT     ON     Free FDISK will reboot the system upon exiting the
;                     program if changes were made to any partition table.

;                     partition active.  Otherwise, it will only set DOS
;                     partition types active.
;         *  TRUE
;            FALSE
;
; VERSION           Version number that Free FDISK will emulate while the
;                     user is using the interactive setup.
;            4      Emulates the MS-FDISK that came with MS-DOS 4.xx.
;            5      Emulates the MS-FDISK that came with MS-DOS 5.xx. 
;            6      Emulates the MS-FDISK that came with MS-DOS 6.xx.
;            W95    Adds support for LBA hard disks.
;            W95B   Same as W95, with the addition of FAT32 support.
;         *  W98    Same as W95B
;            FD     Setting for FreeDOS.  Currently is the same as W95
;                     with ALLOW_4GB_FAT16 set to TRUE.
;
; WRITE   *  ON     Changes will be written the the hard disk(s).
;            OFF    Changes will not be written to the hard disk(s) and
;                     a debugging screen will be displayed.
;
; XO         ON     Extended options will become available in the menus.
;         *  OFF    Extended options will not be available in the menus.
;
;         * Designates default settings if the fdisk.ini file does not 
;           exist or the statement is absent from the fdisk.ini file.
;
;
; To override the autodetection of a hard disk with your own drive geometry:
;     (This function could be used if your BIOS does not correctly detect
;     the geometry of your hard disk.)
;
;     Add the "DRIVE" statement with the syntax of:  DRIVE A-BBBB-CCC-DD
;
;     Where:  A   Represents the drive number
;             B   Represents the number of cylinders
;             C   Represents the number of heads
;             D   Represents the number of sectors
;     i.e.  DRIVE 3-0620-063-64    ->  Sets drive 3 to 620 cylinders, 
;                                      63 heads, and 64 sectors.
;     NOTE:  All fields specified in the DRIVE statement MUST be the EXACT
;            number of characters as indicated above.
;
;     WARNING:  If the drive that you are forcing geometry values for
;               does not exist or the values you enter are greater than
;               what is supported by the hard disk, unpredictable problems
;               will occur.
;
; Always proceed informational lines with a ";" so that Free FDISK ignores
;   that line.
