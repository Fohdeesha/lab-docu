# Setting up Brocade ICX6450

## Preparation
If you haven't already, visit the [Brocade Overview](brocade-overview.md) page to download the latest guide package and get it ready to be served via TFTP - this unified package includes all the latest firmware, licenses, and documentation.  

**Connect** to the serial/console port on the front using a program like Putty (9600 8N1), then connect the **management ethernet port** to your network (do NOT use any of the regular switch ports yet).


Power on the switch while watching your serial terminal - start smashing the `b` key until you're dropped into the bootloader prompt, which looks like `ICX64XX-boot>` . If you missed the prompt and it boots the OS instead, pull power and try again.

Now at the boot prompt, we tell the switch to clear all current configs and old keys, so it boots into a fresh state:

```
factory set-default
```
To confirm this action, you must send CAPITAL `Y` - sending a lowercase `y` will just make it abort.

Now we need to give the bootloader a temporary IP on your network, as well as supply the IP of your TFTP server where it can find your files. Replace the example IPs with your own. This IP is only going to be used temporarily by the bootloader. We'll also tell it the filename & path of the firmware image. You should not need to alter this:

```
setenv ipaddr 192.168.1.50
setenv netmask 255.255.255.0

#tell the switch the IP of your tftp server:
setenv serverip 192.168.1.8
setenv image_name ICX64xx/ICX64R08030u.bin
setenv uboot ICX64xx/kxz10105.bin
```
Now we can tell it to flash the new OS and bootloader:
```
update_primary
update_uboot
```
After a couple minutes, it should complete. Now we clear the temporary IP, then reboot the switch into the OS:
```
setenv ipaddr
saveenv
reset
```

## Initial Configuration

Now that it's booted into the full OS you may get ***TFTP timed out*** errors in the console, this is normal. just hit enter until they go away. We'll fix that in the next section. Now to make any changes we must enter the enable level:
```
enable
```
Now we enter the configure terminal level to make config changes:
```
configure terminal
```
Now we turn off the DHCP client, so it doesn't automatically grab an IP and look for a TFTP config (the cause of the earlier timeout messages):
```
ip dhcp-client disable
```
Now we give the switch its permanent IP address. By default, all ports are in VLAN 1, so it will behave like a typical switch. First we need to give VLAN 1 its own virtual interface:
```
vlan 1
router-interface ve 1
exit
```
Now we need to assign that virtual interface an address. Choose an IP that is unused in your subnet, and out of your DHCP server range (ping it first to be sure it's unused):
```
interface ve 1
ip address 192.168.1.55/24
exit
write mem
```

## Configuration Details

Now your switch is set up for basic switching, and has an IP address you can use to manage the switch. **Note:** You should now unplug your ethernet connection from the dedicated management port, and instead connect it to any of the **regular switch ports**. Then continue below to give the switch a friendly name:
```
hostname intertubes
```
Now tell it to generate an RSA keypair - this is the first step to enable SSH access:
```
crypto key zeroize
crypto key generate rsa modulus 2048
```

## Update PoE Firmware
 If your switch is the PoE model, you need to update the PoE controller firmware. If it's a non-PoE model, skip this section. Assuming you completed the previous section and the switch now has in-band network access, just do the following:

**Note:** if you have the white mini C12 version of this switch, use the `icx64xxc12_poeplus_02.03.09.fw` file instead.
```
exit
inline power install-firmware stack-unit 1 tftp 192.168.1.8 ICX64xx/icx64xx_poeplus_02.1.0.b004.fw
#after a few seconds, hit enter to return to cli
#save changes you made from the previous section
write memory
#reload the switch
reload
#you'll probably get a message that it hasn't finished. it can take up to 10 minutes
#run "show log" occasionally to monitor the update progress
#try the "reload" command again once it's reached 100%
#once you've rebooted back into the OS:
enable
configure terminal
```
Now you have the latest PoE firmware, and can continue on.

## If Access Protection Is NOT Required
If you do **not** want to password protect access to the switch (you're using it in a lab), follow this section. If you'd like to password protect it, skip this section.

Allow SSH login with no passwords configured:
```
ip ssh permit-empty-passwd yes
```

## If Access Protection IS Required (or WEB-UI Access)
If you do want to secure access to the switch, or use the (limited) web UI, follow this section. If not, skip it.

To secure the switch, we need to create an account - "root" can be any username string you wish:
```
username root password yourpasshere
```
We also need to tell it to use our new local user account(s) to authorize attempts to log in or access the web UI:
```
aaa authentication login default local
aaa authentication web default local
```
If you wanted to use the WEB UI, you can now log into it using the credentials you created above.

You should enable authentication for telnet access as well:
```
enable telnet authentication
```
If your switch is outside of your home, or accessible by others in any way, telnet should be disabled entirely, and access to the serial console should also be password protected. Otherwise skip this step at your discretion:

```
no telnet server
enable aaa console
```

### OPTIONAL: Key Based SSH Access
If you have followed the above to set up authentication, and also wish to disable password-based SSH login and set up a key pair instead, follow this section. If not, skip it. Enable key login, and disable password login:
```
ip ssh key-authentication yes
ip ssh password-authentication no
```
Now we have to generate our key pair with [puttygen](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html) on windows or ```ssh-keygen -t rsa``` on linux. The default settings of RSA @ 2048 bits works without issue. Generate the pair and save out both the public and private key. Note that the ICX6xxx series do *not* support 4096 bit keys - when using `ssh-keygen` or `puttygen` etc, you must create 2048 bit keys.

Copy the public key file to your TFTP server. Then use the following command to import it into your switch:
```
ip ssh pub-key-file tftp 192.168.1.8 public.key
```
You shouldn't need to be told basic key management if you're following this section, but just in case - copy your private key to the proper location on the *nix machine you'll be SSH'ing from, or if you're on windows, load it using [pageant](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html). Now when you SSH to the switch, it will authenticate using your private key.

## Saving & Conclusions
Whenever you make changes (like above) they take effect immediately, however they are not saved to onboard flash. So if you reboot the switch, they will be lost. To permanently save them to onboard flash, use the following command:
```
write memory
```
Your switch now has a basic configuration, as well as an IP address you can telnet or SSH to for further configuration.

Some more useful general commands:

Show chassis information like fan and temperature status:
```
show chassis
```

Show a table of all interfaces:
```
show interface brief
```
To show one interface in detail:
```
show interfaces ethernet 1/1/1
#Also works for virtual interfaces:
show interfaces ve 1
```
Give a port a friendly name:
```
interface ethernet 1/1/1
port-name freenas
show interfaces brief ethernet 1/1/1
exit
```
Show the running configuration:
```
show run
```
Show the system log:
```
show log
```

To remove configuration options, put a ```no``` in front of them at the appropriate CLI level:
```
no hostname intertubes
```
## Tips
To exit the CLI level you are at, use `exit`. So assuming you are still at the ```configure terminal``` level, type the following to exit back to the ```enable``` level:
```
exit
```
Commands can also be shortened, as long as they are still unique. So to re-enter the configure terminal level, Instead of typing the entirety of ```configure terminal```, the following will also work:
```
conf t
```
There is also tab help and completion. To see all the commands available at the current CLI level, just hit tab. To see the options available for a certain command, just type that command (like ```ip```) then hit tab a couple times.

## Advanced Configuration

### Default Route & DNS
To give the switch a default route and a DNS server so it can reach external hostnames and IP's (to ping external servers or to update time via NTP etc), do the following. replace the IP with the IP of your gateway/router/etc. Assuming you are still at the ```configure terminal``` level:

```
ip dns server-address 192.168.1.1
ip route 0.0.0.0/0 192.168.1.1
```
### NTP
To have the switch keep its time synced via NTP (so its logs make more sense), use the following. If you live in an area that doesn't use Daylight Savings, skip the ```clock summer-time``` command. Use tab completion for the timezone command to see what's available. The IP's in the following example are google's NTP servers and work well for most cases:
```
clock summer-time
clock timezone gmt GMT-05
ntp
disable serve
server 216.239.35.0
server 216.239.35.4
exit
```
### SNMP

To quickly enable SNMPv2 (read only), follow the below. SNMP v3 is available but you'll have to refer to the included documentation:
```
snmp-server community public ro
```
### HTTPS Web Interface

To enable https, use the following:
```
web-management https
crypto-ssl certificate generate
```
Disable http:
```
no web-management http
```

### Saving
If you made any of the above extra changes, remember they have not been saved to onboard flash yet. Do so:
```
write memory
```

## SFP/Optics Information
Brocade does not restrict the use of optics by manufacturer, they'll take anything given it's the right protocol. However optical monitoring information is disabled unless it sees Brocade or Foundry optics.

So if you want to see information like this :

```
telnet@Route2(config)#sh optic 1/2/1
 Port  Temperature   Tx Power     Rx Power       Tx Bias Current
+----+-----------+--------------+--------------+---------------+
5       32.7460 C  -002.6688 dBm -002.8091 dBm    5.472 mA
        Normal      Normal        Normal         Normal
```
You'll need to pick up some official Brocade or Foundry optics on ebay, or buy some flashed optics from FiberStore.

## Licensing Info
Like other EoL ICX6xxx series switches, the ICX6450 requires license file unlocks for 10gbE port functionality as well as some advanced software features. These licenses are no longer sold. To prevent e-waste and save these from landfills, I am providing free unlocks for use in a homelab or personal environment. Once you've finished the update and configuration process, proceed to the [ICX6450 Licensing](6450.md) section to fully license and unlock your switch.
