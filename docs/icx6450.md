# Setting up Brocade ICX6450

## Preparation
If you haven't already, visit the [Brocade Overview](brocade-overview.md) page to download the latest guide package and get it ready to be served via TFTP - this unified package includes all the latest firmware, licenses, and documentation.  

**Connect** to the serial/console port on the front using a program like Putty (9600 8N1), then connect the **management ethernet port** to your network (do NOT use any of the regular switch ports yet).


Power on the switch while watching your serial terminal - start smashing the `b` key until you're dropped into the bootloader prompt, which looks like `ICX64XX-boot>` . If you missed the prompt and it boots the OS instead, pull power and try again.

Now at the boot prompt, we tell the switch to clear all current configs and old keys, so it boots into a fresh state:

```
factory set-default
```
To confirm this action, you must send CAPITAL `Y` - sending a lowercase `y` will just make it abort.

Now we need to give the bootloader a temporary IP on your network, as well as supply the IP of your TFTP server where it can find your files. Replace the example IPs with your own. This IP is only going to be used temporarily by the bootloader. We'll also tell it the filename & path of the firmware image. You should not need to alter this:

```
setenv ipaddr 192.168.1.50
setenv netmask 255.255.255.0

#tell the switch the IP of your tftp server:
setenv serverip 192.168.1.8
setenv image_name ICX64xx/ICX64R08030u.bin
setenv uboot ICX64xx/kxz10105.bin
```
Now we can tell it to flash the new OS and bootloader:
```
update_primary
update_uboot
```
After a couple minutes, it should complete. Now we clear the temporary IP, then reboot the switch into the OS:
```
setenv ipaddr
saveenv
reset
```

## Initial Configuration

Now that it's booted into the full OS you may get ***TFTP timed out*** errors in the console, this is normal. just hit enter until they go away. We'll fix that in the next section. Now to make any changes we must enter the enable level:
```
enable
```
Now we enter the configure terminal level to make config changes:
```
configure terminal
```
Now we turn off the DHCP client, so it doesn't automatically grab an IP and look for a TFTP config (the cause of the earlier timeout messages):
```
ip dhcp-client disable
```
Now we give the switch its permanent IP address. By default, all ports are in VLAN 1, so it will behave like a typical switch. First we need to give VLAN 1 its own virtual interface:
```
vlan 1
router-interface ve 1
exit
```
Now we need to assign that virtual interface an address. Choose an IP that is unused in your subnet, and out of your DHCP server range (ping it first to be sure it's unused):
```
interface ve 1
ip address 192.168.1.55/24
exit
write mem
```
Now your switch is set up for basic switching, and has an IP address you can use to manage the switch. But you're not done yet!

> **Note:**  You should now unplug your ethernet connection from the dedicated management port, and instead connect it to any of the  **regular switch ports**. If you skip this, the rest of the guides will not work.


## Update PoE Firmware
If your switch is the PoE model, you need to update the PoE controller firmware. If it's a non-PoE model, skip this section. Assuming you completed the previous section and the switch now has in-band network access (one of the regular ports are connected), just do the following:

**Note:** if you have the small white C12 version of this switch, use the `icx64xxc12_poeplus_02.03.09.fw` file instead.
```
exit
inline power install-firmware stack-unit 1 tftp 192.168.1.8 ICX64xx/icx64xx_poeplus_02.1.0.b004.fw
#after a few seconds, hit enter to return to cli
#save changes you made from the previous section
write memory
#reload the switch
reload
#you'll probably get a message that it hasn't finished. it can take up to 10 minutes
#run "show log" occasionally to monitor the update progress
#try the "reload" command again once it's reached 100%
#once you've rebooted back into the OS:
enable
configure terminal
```
Now you have the latest PoE firmware, and can continue on.


## Licensing Info
Like other EoL ICX6xxx series switches, the ICX6450 requires license file unlocks for 10gbE port functionality as well as some advanced software features. These licenses are no longer sold. To prevent e-waste and save these from landfills, I am providing free unlocks for use in a homelab or personal environment. Once you've finished the update and configuration process, proceed to the [ICX6450 Licensing](6450.md) section to fully license and unlock your switch.
