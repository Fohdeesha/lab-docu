# Welcome
This is the home of all public documentation by Jon Sands (fohdeesha). It is mostly comprised of hardware/firmware hacking & reverse engineering guides, the ones I am comfortable publishing publicly.  It is mostly discussed and designed for [STH](https://forums.servethehome.com/index.php?threads/brocade-icx6450-icx6610-etc.21107/) members. Pull requests to the [github repo](https://github.com/Fohdeesha/lab-docu) are always welcome. For sensitive information & projects please contact me using the contact link in the banner above.

Other documentation I have written or contributed to:

 - [Brokeaid Crossflashing](https://brokeaid.com/)
 - [Xen Orchestra](https://docs.xen-orchestra.com/)
 - [XCP-ng](https://docs.xcp-ng.org/)

## Offline / Archival Version
Below you can download an entirely offline version of this entire guide site, including all files / ZIPs. The archive linked below is automatically re-created whenever the build script for this website is run, so it is always up to date. Once downloaded, extract it and open `index.html` with your favorite web browser, and you can use the site entirely offline.

**NOTE:** This site is updated *very* often, with useful information and updates being added nearly weekly. I do not recommend downloading and using the offline version for regular use, as you're going to miss out on any updates made to the guide since your download. It's intended for a "worst case scenario" backup.
