# Welcome
This is the home of all public documentation by Jon Sands. Originally planned as documentation to share amongst [FBOM](http://fbom.club/) members, it has become most useful on [STH](https://forums.servethehome.com/index.php?threads/brocade-icx6450-icx6610-etc.21107/). Pull requests to the [github repo](https://github.com/Fohdeesha/lab-docu) are always welcome.

Other documentation I have written or contributed to:

 - [Brokeaid Crossflashing](https://brokeaid.com/)
 - [Xen Orchestra](https://xen-orchestra.com/docs/)
 - [XCP-ng](https://xcp-ng.org/docs/)

The archive linked below is automatically re-created whenever the build script for this website is run, so it is always up to date. Once downloaded, extract it and open `index.html` with your favorite web browser, and you can use the site entirely offline:
