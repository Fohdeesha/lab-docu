Thankfully starting with FastIron v8080, the entire ICX7xxx series uses honor-based licensing - meaning no actual licenses are needed.  

You just need to upgrade to the latest firmware, and run the `license install` commands. Instructions on my update guide here: [ICX7150 Update Guide](http://fohdeesha.com/docs/icx7150/)
